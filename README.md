I’m a Geomatic Engineer bridging the gap between Geospatial Science and Computer Science. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science, focusing on Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds (Segmentation/Classification).
My core expertise lies in automating complex geoprocesses within the mining industry—transforming raw data (Lidar, GNSS) into actionable intelligence using Python, AI, and robust data pipelines.

## 💼 Experience & Projects

* GeoAI & Point Cloud Analytics: Development of Deep Learning pipelines (e.g., RandLA-Net) for semantic segmentation and classification of 3D mining data (LiDAR/Photogrammetry).
* High-Performance Geoprocessing: Custom scripting in Python and Global Mapper to automate massive LAZ/TIF processing, reducing workflows from hours to minutes.
* GIS Pipeline Architecture: Design of robust ETL pipelines for ingestion, validation, and transformation of spatial data (WGS84 ↔ UTM ↔ Local Grid).
* Enterprise Integration: Automated data extraction from SQL Server to GIS for real-time mining operation monitoring and reporting.
* Applied Mining Topography: 3D surface modeling, volume calculation, and DEM generation for autonomous operations.
