I’m a Geomatic Engineer bridging the gap between Geospatial Science and Computer Science. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science, focusing on Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds (Segmentation/Classification).
My core expertise lies in automating complex geoprocesses within the mining industry—transforming raw data (Lidar, GNSS) into actionable intelligence using Python, AI, and robust data pipelines.

# 💼 Experience & Projects
## 🧠 GeoAI & Software Development (Current)

* GeoAI & Point Cloud Analytics: Development of Deep Learning pipelines (e.g., RandLA-Net) for semantic segmentation and classification of 3D mining data (LiDAR/Photogrammetry).
* Full-Stack Web GIS: Designed and deployed end-to-end systems (e.g., Canchas Anglo) for mining resource management. Includes automated SQL Server ↔ GIS pipelines for real-time monitoring.
* QGIS Plugin Development: Created custom plugins (e.g., Canchas LT) to automate complex topological validations, reducing workflow time by 90%.

## 🚜 Mining Operations & Data Engineering (Operational Background)

* Autonomous Haulage Systems (AHS) Komatsu Analytics: Processed high-frequency GNSS telemetry from autonomous truck fleets to analyze speed patterns, congestion queues, and operational efficiency using Python (Pandas/Geopandas).
* Complex Geodetic Transformations: Expert management of coordinate systems (WGS84 ↔ PSAD56 ↔ Local Mine Grids). Developed automated scripts to ensure sub-meter precision in transformations where commercial software often fails.
* High-Volume Spatial Data Pipelines: Automated the ingestion and cleaning of massive datasets (Lidar .LAZ, Drone Orthophotos), ensuring data integrity for downstream engineering applications.
